        <h2>The Rod from God</h2>
        <p>The Rods of God were first thought up in a science fiction context. The idea being that you would launch into orbit large tungsten rods the size of telophone poles, then remotely drop them on targeted locations. In speculative calculations the power of the impact would be similar to 11 and a half tons of TNT. Through the years 2000-2014 the US military did many tests on the feesibiliy of putting this sci-fy idea into the real world. </p>

        <h3>Do you think they ever put the Rods from God Into Production?</h3>
