    <h1>My site shall be called: the Tungston Info Center</h1>
    <h2>My Purpose:</h2>
    <p>This site will see to all you would ever need to know about tungston, it will help bring it into the information circles of all kinds of people. </p>
    <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
    <p>When someone askes you what atomic number tungston is, now you have a dedicated Go-To to help you in this dire circumstance</p>
    <p>Or maybe you feel left out of your friend group because they know about the "Rod of God" military project, and you had no idea that the military thought of using tungston rods from space as an offensive weapon.  There ya go, 2 perfectly normal senarios in which you could find yourself in at ANY time ;)</p>
