        <p>Tungsten, number 74 on the periodic table. It is a very interesting metal due to its unique qualities. Its atomic symbol is W whitch originates from its other name Wolfram. It is a rare element found on earth almost only as already mixed, it is also a notoriously hard metal to work with. It has an extremely high melting point, making it the most heat resistant of all metals. Additionally it is very dense, coming in seventh place for most dense element, and its chemical makup makes it extremely acid resistant. Making both strong acid and strong bases harmless at normal tempratures, however acids or bases can have an effect if used on red-hot tungston as the heat allows for a much stronger reaction.

        <p>The following is a video of a man who loved tungston. On amazon there are several entries for buying variously sized tungston objects, mainly cubes but sometimes other things. These are not necessarily popular, but in the world of tungston, for the ordinary citizen these cubes are probably the best chance of seeing and possibly touching tungston in its pure form. The script to this animated video is word for word with a corresponding amazon review given on the affor mentioned tungston cubes. Enjoy!</p>
