        <h2>As an Alloy</h2>
        <p>Tungsten is Used commonly as an alloy of other metals. When mixed with othere metals it lends additional tensile strength aswell as and increased heat resistance. This is especially useful in arc-welding aplications and in high temperature furnaces.</p>

        <h2>Electronics</h2>
        <p>In addition to its extrordinarily high temperature resistance, it also has a good conductivity rating. making it ideal for making conections in electronic circuts, especially when you want your circuits to be durable.  </p>

        <h2>Radiation Absorber</h2>
        <p>Tungsten also Does an amazing job of blocking radiation. Whether for medical purposes or in nuclear power plants you would have a hard time finding a better metal for the job. It is a truely ideal metal for usage in such situations.</p>
